          <h2>BOOKING APPOINTMENTS</h2>
          <p>
            Our cozy boutique hair salon has limited availability for coloring
            appointments each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to this constraint, our clients are encouraged to plan ahead and
            reserve their spot well in advance. This proactive approach helps us
            avoid overcrowding and ensures that each client receives
            personalized attention.

          <p>
            To secure their spot, clients can conveniently book appointments
            through our user-friendly website booking system.
